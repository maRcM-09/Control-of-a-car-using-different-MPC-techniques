# Control-of-a-car-using-different-MPC-techniques

This project explores the development of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) cruise controller tailored for a car navigating a highway scenario, with all simulations executed in MATLAB. The car model, including its non-linear dynamics, is provided and serves as the foundation for the project. The car dynamics are linearized and then decomposed into longitudinal and lateral subsystems, enabling focused control strategies. MPC controllers were designed for each subsystem, ensuring smooth and responsive driving behavior. Moreover, an offset-free MPC controller to address practical MPC issues such as disturbances and tracking was implemented. Additionally, the implementation of a robust tube MPC controller for adaptive cruise control, which ensures safe distances from other vehicles despite uncertainties is added. And finally the design of a non-linear MPC (NMPC) controller using RK4 discretization, showcasing its application for tasks such as highway cruising and overtaking maneuvers.

Results are available in the report attached to the project for a more rigorous explanation.
