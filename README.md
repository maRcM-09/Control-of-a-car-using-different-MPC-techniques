# Control-of-a-car-using-different-MPC-techniques

This project explores the development of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) cruise controller tailored for a car navigating a highway scenario, with all simulations executed in MATLAB. The car model, including its non-linear dynamics, is provided and serves as the foundation for the project.In Section 2, the car dynamics are linearized and then decomposed into longitudinal and lateral subsystems, enabling focused control strategies. Section 3 presents the design of tracking MPC controllers for each subsystem, ensuring smooth and responsive driving behavior. Section 4 introduces an offset-free MPC controller to address practical MPC issues such as disturbances and tracking. Section 5 describes the implementation of a robust tube MPC controller for adaptive cruise control, which ensures safe distances from other vehicles despite uncertainties. Section 6 transitions to the design of a non-linear MPC (NMPC) controller using RK4 discretization, showcasing its application for tasks such as highway cruising and overtaking maneuvers.
